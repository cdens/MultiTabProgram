README File for mainprogram.py:

This sample program creates a PyQt5 QMainWindow class (the main window for a complex GUI).
It includes the ability to create/rename/close multiple tabs for your program, as well as some 
data saving, error handling, and basic color pallette features. 

The only dependency that doesn't ship with python base is PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5).

Licensing- PyQt5 has its own licensing requirements. See the License.txt file for licensing specific to this program.
