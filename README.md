This sample program creates a PyQt5 QMainWindow class (the main window for a complex GUI).
It includes the ability to create/rename/close multiple tabs for your program, as well as some 
data saving, error handling, and basic color pallette features. 

The only dependency that doesn't ship with python base is PyQt5 (`pip install PyQt5`).

Licensing- PyQt5 has its own licensing requirements. See the License.txt file for licensing specific to this program.

Feel free to point out any issues or request additional features (no promises though).
